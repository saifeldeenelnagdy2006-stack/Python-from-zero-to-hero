## 📌 Assignment Problems

### 1. Sorting a List of Numbers
Collects numeric input from the user, stores it in a list, and displays the list in ascending and descending order.

### 2. Modifying a List Using a Function
Demonstrates list manipulation through a function by appending, inserting, removing elements, and returning the modified list.

### 3. Student Names and Grades
Stores student names and grades, then identifies the highest and lowest grades using list operations.

### 4. Modifying a Fruits List
Applies multiple list operations including insertions, updates, deletions, and indexing on a list of fruits.

### 5. Name and Age Classification
Classifies a user into age groups (Young, Adult, Senior) based on input using conditional statements.

### 6. Counting Values in a List
Uses loops to analyze a list of numbers and count values based on given conditions.

### 7. Removing All Occurrences from a List
Implements a clean approach to remove all instances of a specific value from a list.

### 8. Number Guessing Game 🎯
An interactive guessing game that provides feedback and tracks the number of attempts until success.

### 9. Shopping List Manager 🛒
A menu-driven program that allows users to add, remove, sort, and manage shopping items dynamically.

### 10. City Names and Lengths 🌍
Stores city names and outputs each city along with its character count.
